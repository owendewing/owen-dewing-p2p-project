# owen-dewing-p2p-project
Usage: My p2p project is a blog application called Blogorama where you can post anything you want! You just have to include your name under the author section, a subject, a body, and you can choose if you want your post to be public or private! You first create a username and password to log into the application. Then you can type create post to create any type of blog you want. You can also type search posts to search the blogs by author. If you don't like your post, you can delete it with delete post (deleted by id). Finally, to see all previous blogposts, type see posts. Post away!

Proposal: First off, I am going to fly solo for this project, but I will test my app in the Keck Lab or in class with another computer. For my app, I want to create a blog post platform that allows users to share text and images with each other. Instead of my struct being called “recipe”, it will probably be called something like “Blogpost” or “Blog”, with variables called “id”, “name”, “text”, and “image”. If I wanted to make it more complex, I could add variables such as “subject” (giving each post a subject) or “video” (to allow for video sharing). I will adapt a lot of the code from the Recipe example and adapt it to fit my Blog theme.
